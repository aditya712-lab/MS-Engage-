# Objective

- The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an application that the Automotive Industry could use to harness data to make informed decisions. 
- It helps to find out which is the most popular car **on the basis** of its engine type, fuel type, mileage, model, etc. 
- It will help them to figure out the trending designs of cars and can use those reports to accordingly **manipulate the design of the cars**,by making them more      **optimized, customer-centric, and innovative**. 
- It also allows them to **find out the relation between** different parameters like how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. With the help of **customer segmentation**, they can find which group of people prefers which features.



# General Information about the Project

This project uses the concept of Data Analysis to demonstrate how the Automotive Industry could harness data to make informed decisions.

I have used this Dataset->[cars](https://github.com/Shweta2024/cars-engage-2022/blob/main/cars.csv)

- Since the given dataset had missing values, I deleted the columns having more than 60% missing values.

- Followed by filling the missing values with the mode of the column.

- Then, **I used plots such as** : bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots to display the relationship between different attributes(features of the cars).

- Followed by using an Elbow plot to find the optimal value of K to apply **K-Means Clustering** ,so as  to group the people on the basis of the Displacement and the Ex-Showroom Price

- Prior to using K-means Clustering, I scaled the values of Displacement and Ex-showroom Price, for making data points generalized so that the distance between them will be lower.
 




## Features

Below are the informations that can be found from my application :- 

- The most popular Car as per their Make , Model,Fuel Type ,Body Type, etc.
- How exactly the prices vary with the independent variables.
- Customer segments.





## Room for Improvement

- Since the aim of the project was to use data analysis,I have not used any algorithm to predict the price of a car.Although, algorithms like **Linear Regression** and  **Random Forest Algorithm** can be used for predicting the price of the car.
