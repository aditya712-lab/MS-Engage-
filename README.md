# MS-Engage/Recommendations



# Movie Recommendation System

>Developed an application to demonstrate how users and choose movies of his/her choice and get to know the basic details of the movie selected, such as Genres,Top Casts,Budget etc.

>Also Recommendations are given on the basic of current movie selected and users are allowed to set Count of Number of Recommendations

>Users can Search the movie by name and also can Filter the movies on the basis of Genres.

> Live demo [here]()

# Objective

- The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an application that has the ability to recommend movies to user Accurately. 
- It helps to Recommend movies on the basis of **Content Based Filtering**. 
- It will help them to Choose Movies which are very similary to what they viewed previously. 
- It also allows them to Filter Movies on the Basis of Multiple Genres which Enhances the user Experience.



# General Information about the Project

This project uses the concept of Data Analysis to demonstrate how the Automotive Industry could harness data to make informed decisions.

I have used this Dataset-

- Since the given dataset had missing values, I deleted the columns having more than 60% missing values.

- Followed by filling the missing values with the mode of the column.

- Then, **I used plots such as** : bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots to display the relationship between different attributes(features of the cars).

- Followed by using an Elbow plot to find the optimal value of K to apply **K-Means Clustering** ,so as  to group the people on the basis of the Displacement and the Ex-Showroom Price

- Prior to using K-means Clustering, I scaled the values of Displacement and Ex-showroom Price, for making data points generalized so that the distance between them will be lower.
 




## Features

Below are the informations that can be found from my application :- 

- The most popular Car as per their Make , Model,Fuel Type ,Body Type, etc.
- How exactly the prices vary with the independent variables.
- Customer segments.




## Similarity Score 

   How does it decide which item is most similar to the item user likes? Here come the similarity scores.
   
   It is a numerical value ranges between zero to one which helps to determine how much two items are similar to each other on a scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained measuring the similarity between the text details of both of the items. So, similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items. This can be done by cosine-similarity.
   
## How Cosine Similarity works?
  Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
