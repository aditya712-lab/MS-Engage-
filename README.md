# Movies Recommendation System

>Developed an application to demonstrate how users and choose movies of his/her choice and get to know the basic details of the movie selected, such as Genres,Top Casts,Budget etc.

>Also Recommendations are given on the basic of current movie selected and users are allowed to set Count of Number of Recommendations

>Users can Search the movie by name and also can Filter the movies on the basis of Genres.

# Objective

- The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an application that has the ability to recommend movies to user Accurately. 
- It helps to Recommend movies on the basis of **Content Based Filtering**. 
- It will help them to Choose Movies which are very similary to what they viewed previously. 
- It also allows them to Filter Movies on the Basis of Multiple Genres which Enhances the user Experience.
- User also Can Seeach for the movie by Searching the name of the movie.


# General Information about the Project

This project uses the concept of Content Based Filtering,Searching Subsequence Algorithms Optimally.

Dataset Used-

- The Dataset  contains two .CSV files which contains  ,Movie Details and Movie Credits.
- Since there were many missing details in the CSV file, so the Dataset has to be Refined.
- The Data manipulations and Required Function are implemented in Python/Flask in the Backend.

 




## Features

Below are the informations that can be found from my application :- 

- Recommending movies accurately.
- Good User Experience for which React has been used to Get Instant results with every Change.
- Multiple Filter on  the basis of Genres  takes user experience One step ahead.
- Searching Movies by Name and Giving five Suggestions for the typed letters,which eventually takes user to Details and Recommendation Page.




## Similarity Score 

   How does it decide which item is most similar to the item user likes? Here come the similarity scores.
   
   It is a numerical value ranges between zero to one which helps to determine how much two items are similar to each other on a scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained measuring the similarity between the text details of both of the items. So, similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items. This can be done by cosine-similarity.
   
## How Cosine Similarity works?
  Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
